    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">
      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words
    </p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would advise the client to only give access to people on a need-to-know basis.<br> 
      The users should have different and long passwords in case of a brute force attack, and not use usernames and passwords that’s self-explanatory (“birthday”, “addresses”, Admin, 1 2 3 4 5 6, etc.).<br>
      An open-standard authorization protocol or framework (OAuth) is a great way to achieve a secure login.<br><br>
      
      The site should use HTTPS, which encrypts the communication session so that no unauthorized person can eavesdrop or change data during transmission over open networks.<br>
      Google also ranks websites using HTTPS higher than HTTP in their search engine.<br><br>
      
      Build separate database servers and file servers in case of a successful attack.<br> 
      In case of a successful attack, it’s also a good idea to have an off-site backup.<br><br>
      
      Use good measures when coding against the OWASP top 10, as these are the most common breaches/security threats.
      This includes sanitizing of data, continuous deployment and- integration (CI/CD), automatic user timeout, etc.<br>
      It’s possible to make use of trustworthy third-party applications on some of these security measures.<br><br> 
      
      A good host and network security is of course essential.<br><br>
      
      Also, a good idea is to have an security.txt file with contact information and a Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP). This way it’s easier for developers and bug bounty hunters to report vulnerabilities.
